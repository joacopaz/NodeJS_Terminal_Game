## NODEJS Terminal Game

#### Intuitive NodeJS terminal game, you start on the top left and you must find your way to the exit (the little hat `^` )

#### The maps are generated procedurally and can be customized (in width, height and difficulty level by changing the holes variable).

#### Just run the main.exe file to start playing!
